## Text-Based Machine Learning Classifier for Unlabeled Data
This repository contains a project focused on building a machine learning classifier for text data. The dataset, provided in the form of an email attachment, includes records with no predefined labels. The goal of the project is to identify and assign meaningful labels based on the content of the "Request Detail" ,  "Notes" fields, "Subject", fields, "Subject_Eng" fields and "Request Type" fields which are predominantly in Arabic, though English may also be present.


### The primary objectives of this project are:
<details>
  <summary><b>1. Data Processing: Implement a strategy to generate labels from the text data. The labels should reflect key discrepancies or noteworthy information derived from the "Request Detail" and "Notes" fields.</b></summary>
  Techniques:
  - Remove Null values
  - Remove Duplicate values
  - Remove Special Characters
  - Remove Punctuations
  - Remove Numbers
  - Remove Arabic Stop Words
  - Remove English Stop Words
  - Remove Whitespace
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b></summary>
  Perform EDA to understand the distribution of the data, the presence of missing values, and the need for data cleaning. Use visualizations and statistical techniques to uncover patterns and insights from the dataset.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>3. Dimensionality Reduction</b></summary>
  Apply dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE to visualize the data in a lower-dimensional space. This helps in understanding the inherent structure of the data and identifying clusters or outliers.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>4. Feature Engineering</b></summary>
  Explore various natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract and preprocess features from the text data in both Arabic and English. Techniques may include tokenization, stop-word removal, word embeddings.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>5. Data Labeling</b></summary>
  Implement a strategy to generate labels from the text data. The labels should reflect key discrepancies or noteworthy information derived from the "Request Detail" and "Notes" fields. Utilize techniques such as fuzzy matching, keyword extraction, Zero-shot classification, Few-shot classification and manual annotation where necessary.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>6. Text Classification</b></summary>
  Develop a machine learning model to classify the labeled data, ensuring high accuracy and relevance. Experiment with different classification models such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and deep learning models to find the best fit.
</details>


<details>
  <summary><b>7. Model Evaluation</b></summary>
  Assess the performance of the model using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall. Compare the predictions against a validation set of manually labeled data to measure the effectiveness of the model.
</details>

### Key Features

<details>
  <summary><b>1. Automated Labeling</b></summary>
  Utilizes custom algorithms and techniques such as fuzzy matching, keyword extraction, and semantic analysis to generate labels for the text data. This helps in the efficient categorization of unstructured data and reduces manual effort.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>2. NLP Techniques</b></summary>
  Implements preprocessing steps like tokenization, stop-word removal, and word embeddings to handle the complexity of Arabic and English text. These techniques enable the extraction of meaningful features from the text, facilitating better model performance.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>3. Model Evaluation</b></summary>
  Employs metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall to validate the model's effectiveness in text classification. Detailed performance reports are generated to guide further improvements and refinements in the model.

## Text-Based Machine Learning Classifier for Unlabeled Data
This repository contains a project focused on building a machine learning classifier for text data. The dataset, provided in the form of an email attachment, includes records with no predefined labels. The goal of the project is to identify and assign meaningful labels based on the content of the "Request Detail" ,  "Notes" fields, "Subject", fields, "Subject_Eng" fields and "Request Type" fields which are predominantly in Arabic, though English may also be present.


### Project Overview
The primary objectives of this project are:
<details>
  <summary><b>1. Data Processing</b></summary>
  Implement a strategy to generate labels from the text data. The labels should reflect key discrepancies or noteworthy information derived from the "Request Detail" and "Notes" fields.
</details>

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to understand the distribution of the data, the presence of missing values, and the need for data cleaning.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA or t-SNE to visualize the data in a lower-dimensional space.

4.**Feature engineering**: Explore various natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract and preprocess features from the text data in both Arabic and English.
5. **Data Labeling**: Implement a strategy to generate labels from the text data. The labels should reflect key discrepancies or noteworthy information derived from the "Request Detail" and "Notes" fields.
6. **Text Classification**: Develop a machine learning model to classify the labeled data, ensuring high accuracy and relevance.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the model using standard evaluation metrics, comparing the predictions against a validation set of manually labeled data.

### Key Features

- **Automated Labeling**: Utilizes custom algorithms and techniques such as fuzzy matching, keyword extraction, and semantic analysis to generate labels.
- **NLP Techniques**: Implements preprocessing steps like tokenization, stop-word removal, and word embeddings to handle the complexity of Arabic text.
- **Model Evaluation**: Employs metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall to validate the model's effectiveness in text classification.
